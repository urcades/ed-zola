I've been following through a "Foundations of Computing" curriculum facilitated by some folks at [Fractal University](https://fractalnyc.com/university). My hope has been to gain a better understanding of some of the lower-level architectural underpinnings of the medium I spend a lot of time designing around (computers) and why the computer I'm working on (urbit) is meaningfully differentiated from how most others are constructed.

The core of the coursework revolves around [nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org), which is an "open" coursework designed by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken. Additional materials that contextualize this core framework have been gathered by our class's primary facilitator, Andrew Rose. These materials comprise of a collection of video, pdfs, and other interactive methods of deconstructing the low-level elements of most computers.

Overall, I've been having a fun time learning about binary logic and arithmetic. As I work with the concepts

Binary Addition

<E/> 
How does binary addition work?

<O/> 
Binary addition works similarly to decimal addition but uses base-2 numbers. Here's the breakdown:

```
0+0=0
0+1=1
1+0=1
1+1=10 (similar to carrying over in decimal)
```

Example: Let's add 1011 and 1101:

1. Align the numbers:

```
 1011
+1101
-----
```

2. Add bit-by-bit, starting from the rightmost bit.

```
 1011
+1101
-----
   00   (1+1   = 10, carry 1)
  10    (1+0+1 = 10, carry 1)
 10     (1+1+0 = 10, carry 1)
10      (1+0+1 = 10, carry 1)
1       (carry-over         )
```

<E/> 
Why does 1 + 1 = 10 in binary addition?

<O/> 
In binary, each position represents a power of 2, much like each position in a decimal number represents a power of 10. When you add 1 + 1 in binary, you need to carry over to the next position because you've exceeded the highest value for a single bit, which is 1.

Here's how it works:

1 + 1 = 2 in decimal.

In binary, 2 is represented as 10.

So, 1 + 1 in binary rolls over to, just like 9 + 1 rolls over to 10 in decimal.

<E/> 
What's 0 + 0 in binary addition?

<O/> 
In binary addition, 0 + 0 = 0.

This is straightforward because you're essentially adding the smallest element in the base-2 number system to itself, resulting in the same value. No carry-over is needed.

<E/> 
what's 1 + 0 in binary addition?

<O/> 
In binary addition, 1 + 0 = 1.

Just like in decimal, adding zero to any number leaves the number unchanged. No carry-over is needed.
