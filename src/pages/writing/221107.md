It would be a mistake to characterize our work as that which is strictly technologically interesting. 

Sure, Urbit is a virtual machine, a virtual computer running in your everyday commodity operating system, a peer-to-peer network, a new conception of how a personal computer might be constructed, architected, and otherwise designed, but basing one’s understanding of Urbit as a project in technological terms misses the point. 

Ceramics are frequently cited as being one of the older human arts, originating in Paleolithic times. Pottery may have come along a bit later, according to some sources. 

There’s this notion that computers these days are done, 
there’s little left in the way of 
exploring what constitutes a personal, commodity, workaday 
computer that anyone might use. We have phones, 
tiny supercomputers, head-mounted displays, 
virtual reality goggles, 
and 
while the 
physical form factors 
of computers are evolving 
and integrating themselves closer 
to people’s bodies, there’s a sense 
that at the abstract hearts of these devices, 
the thing we call computer is essentially frozen.

Imagining a world where “ceramics” are conceived as pottery, as vessels, and as 

only vessels

is a little silly, but a point stands: 

Computers can be infinitely formed as clay can be infinitely formed. 
Clay, and its rendering into ceramic material, doesn’t find its only use in the formation of vessels. 
Clay as a material has been used to form ancient toys, currencies, bricks, entire buildings, entire architectural movements, statues, jewelry, tools, and a huge variety of other useful objects. 

I feel like we live in a world where the vast potential of “computers” as a material has been formed into a single shape and left to gather dust. This is the formalism of Unix, of Linux, of unix-like software, of files, of C, of Bell Labs, of client/server, of mega corporations, etc.

Urbit is a nascent 
project with the aim 
of reintroducing 
a computer with 
a fundamentally different shape
than the computers we know now.
