It’s sprinkling outside and I made my way to 85 Quay. I’m reflecting on the journey, as always.

“Heaven in the every day.”

Two days ago, I was granted the chance to check out AmericaOS, a new project by dear friend Keaton Ventura. Using America, I set out in a black sport utility vehicle and began my journey starting off in the middle of Kansas and making my way out eastward.

I was only able to catch a sliver of the experience, having run the simulation on a desktop computer with no speakers attached. There’s a local radio I could have tuned into, a radio I could have connected to others with.

The view from my vehicle’s dashboard mirrors a little bit of the weather I’m experiencing currently:

Today I met with Gordon Brander for lunch and talked a little bit about each of our respective lines of work, areas of research, realms of exploration. Like always, it was a great moment putting a physical face to a digital effusion. Mapping self to self, the limb to the published.

This line of thinking gets me thinking about the literary Tlon: A fairy-tail land, a subsumed space that somehow spills out and slowly begins to fill out the cracks in this world, and quickly begins to cover the surfaces of the world.
