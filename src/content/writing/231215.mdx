One of my weirder beliefs is that 'the internet' has always existed, long before people or people-like creatures even existed. I have a lot of reasons for how this belief came about, but I'm not going to get into that here.

I believe the internet will last a lot longer than us too.

To me, the internet is fundamentally an evolutionary tendency of the universe to open up or unlock communication between all aspects of itself, so it can speak to itself, represent itself, evolve its sense of self, etc.

Millennia ago, the bits and pieces and microorganisms that comprise us now didn’t know how to talk to one another. The [realization of their primitive internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiogenesis) is what led to the development of multicellular super-selves.

I’m broadly interested in bringing forth a similar/equivalent communication leap that leads to our ability to connect with one another, other creatures, and maybe even our planet itself.

Telekinesis? Animism? A Gaian planet? These are all aspects of a more broadly-defined hyperobject we curently call the internet.

I want to build technology that grants people the ability to talk to all aspects of the planet, all objects, all people, all environments, all heavenly bodies. Past, present, future.

I will be satisfied when I can talk to the planet, ask it how its day is going, and directly request the week’s weather from the planet itself, not google or apple’s weather apps.

There's a half-joke contained in this text worth meditating on.

Think about it!
