I decided to write up an update to my old guide, [Personal Computer, Vending Machine](/writing/171020/) (2017). The gist of this text remains the same: I’m simply describing a method to use your “smart” phone in a way that’s kinder to your limited reserve of attention.

This is a contemporary personal computer:

Not a lot has changed in six years.

A phone remains a vending machine for the most part, but a few cracks are beginning to show in how to open up the use of the device.

My phone's lock screen and home screen are still blacked out.

I continue to minimize the number of apps I see on-screen, and don't really use widgets, which are another vector for consuming info without being intentional.
